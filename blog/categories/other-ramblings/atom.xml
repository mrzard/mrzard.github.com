    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So... this is awkward... It's been almost two years without any new content on
this blog. I will do something useful in this 4 hour flight from Helsinki to
Barcelona, and I will try to write some things about what has been going on
with me for those two years.</p>

<p>2015-2016 at <a href="http://www.billymob.com">Billy Mobile</a> were intense and
exciting years . I had the immense luck to start working with some amazing
people like <a href="Dfrison%20LinkedIn">Diego Frisón</a>,
<a href="Joan%20Viladrosa%20linkedin">Joan Viladrosa</a>, <a href="RR%20linkedin">Roger Rafanell</a>,
<a href="Aday%20LIN">Aday Robaina</a>, <a href="Davide%20Ferrari">Davide Ferrari</a>,
<a href="Esardina%20linkedin">Enric Sardina</a>, <a href="gortiz">Ginés Ortiz</a>,
<a href="Oriol%20Blanc">Oriol Blanc</a>, <a href="mrubia">Marc Rubia</a>, <a href="dllorente">David Llorente</a>,
<a href="jona">Jonatan Fernández</a> or <a href="Alex%20Serra">Alex Serra</a>. And that is only
counting people on the Tech Team at Billy. They are all top shelf talent, and
only great things are ahead of them.</p>

<p>With Joan's leadership, the PHP-MySQL-Redis-ElasticSearch Billy adserver
prototype was ported to Java-Kafka-HBase-Spark-Redis-HDFS which made a lot more
sense as to deal with the concurrency and speed needed. He even introduced some
very cool and cutting edge technology like Apache Kylin. At the same time all
of these cool changes were happening, I started realizing that my daughter
needed for me to devote more time to her. And I also started realizing that <em>I</em>
needed to devote more time to her. The fine people at Billy Mobile tried to
work out a semi-remote schedule with me, but it was not the best fit to have
one of the Tech Leads away for a big part of the day, which shifted a lot of
work onto Joan's shoulders, and ended up making obvious that a change had to
be made. So after having the luck of being contacted by
<a href="http://www.dealdash.com">DealDash</a>, it was a golden opportunity for me and
I decided to say goodbye to Billy. I will always be grateful for their support
and effort to help me out, and for the chance to work and learn with so many
amazing people.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dealdash.com">DealDash</a> offered me the opportunity to get back into
a developer position and also start working remotely. The company is based in
Helsinki, and the remote philosophy allows me to do these kinds of things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Take a couple of hours off to bring Ada to the park, or dancing, or to the
"ludoteca". Then either wake up early and work before the daily meeting, or
do it before going to bed at night.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop worrying about the added commute time to and from the office, specially
if I also happened to have to bring Ada to the doctor's. That used to mean
almost a "lost" day when I was working in the office, now it's just a minor
adjustment and no work is lost.</p></li>
<li><p>When I sit to work I just check Slack and the GitHub issues to see what
progress has been made so I can pick up like I were there when it happened.</p></li>
<li><p>If Ada's mom needs to go to the doctor or run any errands, it's a lot easier
for her as she can just leave Ada with me. I just pick up smaller stuff or
bring her to a cafe that has toys where she can play in a new environment
while I keep working.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I think I break most of the 'rules' of working remotely, as other than fixed
meetings (Grooming, Retrospectives, Sprint Planning, Daily standup), I tend to
bend my hours to whichever happens that day. It's working out for me, and at
the same time I can see that it's not for everyone.
But there is a method to my chaos.</p>

<p>At DealDash I have found another amazing team and while I am still learning a
lot about the business of penny auctions, we have already started on the path
of improving and refactoring a lot of functionality. I have been with them for
a little bit over 4 months now and I already have had the chance to try some
new things (for me) like Docker, provisioning machines with Salt, some NodeJS,
using Gherkin to describe the behavior of functionalities and couple that with
unit and/or functional tests and also pick up Symfony again.</p>

<p>DealDash is also teaching me a great deal on how to make a remote team work,
how to keep your team in touch with your users' needs and how to encourage and
foster an open communication style where everyone knows their voices matter.</p>

<p>So what more can I ask for? I am working with once again on an amazing team, on
interesting problems, I am learning new stuff AND I have all the time I need to
devote to my daughter: right now I am heading back to Barcelona from the first
team offsite with DealDash, which I had to cut short because Ada had an
accident. And they were again supportive and understanding.</p>

<p>So this is my new life. I have become a <em>dadveloper</em>.</p>

<p><em>And I could not be happier</em>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So we are closing another year… And I see this is just my fourth post of the year. Pretty bad, but at least is a good starting point, because it’s easy to improve on it.</p>

<p>This will be a long post, so let’s stop it here, and you can proceed to the full wall of text if you feel like it :)</p>

<p>2014 has been a ver eventful year for me. I started the year as the CTO of <a href="http://www.chicplace.com">ChicPlace.com</a>. I had already been there from October 2012, building a custom e-commerce platform over PrestaShop as a prototype. The idea worked pretty well, so, with the help of Denys Pasishnyi and Aldo Chiecchia, we set our sights into building a ‘real’ app in 2013. We started looking for someone dynamic who would help us deliver a full Symfony2 e-commerce website in little to no time. After some search we found <a href="http://mmoreram.com">Marc Morera</a> and enlisted him. We worked our asses off (Aldo, Denys, Marc, Nadal Soler and myself) and we put out a complete solution in August 2013. From then on we tried to build the business and keep improving.</p>

<p>In 2014, ChicPlace was facing interesting challenges (growth, opening a branch in Latin America…), but we had already lost Marc due to budget cuts (luckily he stayed close, in the incubator) and I was growing tired of the non-technical dynamics in ChicPlace, so I in April I came to the conclusion that I had to move forward and wish my pals at ChicPlace good luck. Before I left, though, I was fortunate enough to be around for the birth of <a href="http://www.elcodi.io">ElCodi</a> which came into beign by giving steroids and improving a lot over the idea I had of building an e-commerce web app for the incubator. Marc took the idea to the next level by envisioning an e-commerce components system that is being built now, and not only for the incubator, but for everyone. ElCodi is OSS, and always happy to welcome contributors, so if you have the time, <a href="http://www.github.com/elcodi">go take a look</a> and help some very nice people out!</p>

<p>As I said, in April I announced that I would be leaving ChicPlace on May 30th, and started weighing my options. Came to the conclusion that there are some very nice projects out there. I had some interviews with <a href="http://www.skyscanner.es">SkyScanner</a>, <a href="http://www.schibsted.com">Schibsted</a> and <a href="http://www.adsmurai.com">Adsmurai</a>. Adsmurai is a very interesting project with an awesome team behind and I really wanted to be a part of it, but there were some personal issues I could not resolve and had to recommend them a great programmer (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/monitotxi">Jordi Creus</a>) and keep looking myself. I am happy to say that Jordi is still with Adsmurai and it looks like they are growing very quickly! SkyScanner had a very long selection process, and while I made close to 10 hours of technical tests with them, and a Skype interview, they were still trying to piece the team together and took more than a month to give me feedback. I guess they were trying to make sure they were getting the right people, but the process became too long for me, for reasons I will detail now.</p>

<p>I was still in the processes with Schibsted and SkyScanner when I landed an interview with <a href="http://www.billymob.com">Billy Mobile</a> through ex-teammate and Frontend Developer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hherrerag">Horacio Herrera</a>. I had a very nice chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/_ascandroli">Alejandro Scandroli</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorditamargo">Jordi Tamargo</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gemmallobet">Gemma Llobet</a> and they made an offer that was very much aligned with what I was looking for both in a business and personally. So, with some doubts in my head about the ‘lost’ opportunities with Schibsted and SkyScanner, both established and strong companies, I took the MVAS IT Manager spot at Billy, yet another startup in my resume (since 2008 I’ve almost exclusively worked for startups, except for consulting and training).</p>

<p>At first, Billy was just what I expected. We were shooting from the hip, pushing code to the live servers like maniacs and generally doing tons of work to keep a working business model working. But as the weeks went by, we started to refine ourselves. We introduced the use of composer, some process that resembles a deployment tool, we started using the Symfony components, made a development VM ready with Vagrant, started using ElasticSearch and Symfony2 for some of the projects, started using Redis beyond GET / SET… So basically, while the core business in Billy was (and should be) technically easier than the challenges I had at ChicPlace, we were starting to make it look like a decent technical challenge too. So in this vein, in August we started looking for a developer to join me, as the amount of work surpassed the hours I could put in. The search was very difficult, and made me realize that there are a LOT of outdated developers out there. One thing is not knowing something, but to me, it’s very important that you know that you don’t know it. Let me explain it better. If I am looking for a junior developer, I don’t give a rat’s ass that you cannot explain to me Factory pattern. That’s in a book, you can go look at it anytime you need it. But it’s VERY important that you know it exists, and that you know that you can go look at it anytime you need it. Basically, I need you to be able to find an answer to my questions with 5 minutes and access to Google and StackOverflow. You won’t be able to do that if you do not know what you do not know.</p>

<p>I interviewed people with 4, 5, 6 years of experience that had no idea what Dependency Injection was. They had never used any of the ‘new features’ - I put that in quotes as some of these features are more than some years old - of PHP (no namespaces, no closures, no traits), they had never TRIED to use composer. But after a lot of searching we found <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oriolorellana">Oriol Orellana</a>, a senior developer who had a very good background and was a very good fit for us. We were lucky that he was open to join Billy and he has been with use since November. Oriol has brought with him a lot of order and process to the chaos put in place by beign in a one-man band. And I really hope we can build on that to keep making our technical processes and outputs better, and hopefully keep growing the team.</p>

<p>So, in the professional side, that brings us to December! It has been a very very good year for me professionally. There have been ups and lows, but I am very happy that I have the opportunity to keep working with awesome people and interesting problems.</p>

<p>On the personal side, it’s been pretty eventful too! Not only changing jobs, but I started 2014 with a very BIG news headline: My girlfriend was pregnant! She had a very nice pregnancy and delivered a healthy, beautiful and smiling baby girl on September 21st. Her name is Ada, and all the sleepless nights, the smelly diapers… are more than worth it. My girlfriend and I like challenges so, when Ada was about 5 weeks old we went to Sabadell to check a flat to rent… And we loved it. So my girlfriend organized the moving of a complete family by herself while I kept working and since December 1st we are living in Sabadell.</p>

<p>All in all, as always I have to be grateful to all of the awesome people I keep finding in my path. I am very fortunate to have the family I have, to be in the industry I am in and to have had the opportunities I have had. I hope 2015 is at least as awesome as 2014. And also hope I will be putting some more content here too!</p>
