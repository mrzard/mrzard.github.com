[This article][1] by Charles Miller says there are only two things that are 
**really important** to any discipline. This may or may not be true, but I 
really think he nailed it when it comes to programming.

> 
> **Computer Programming:**
> 
> 1. Every problem can be solved by breaking it up into a series of smaller problems.
> 2. The computer will always do exactly what you tell it to.
> 
> **Software Engineering:**
> 
> 1. Writing the code is the easy part. Writing it so someone else can understand it later is the important part.
> 2. Make it work, then make it elegant, then make it fast.
> 

It's very nice to see there are people out there who can summarize things in 
such a comprehensive and spot-on manner.
