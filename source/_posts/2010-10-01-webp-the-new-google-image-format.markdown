WebP is the new format Google is pushing to come to the rescue of broadband 
usage and get the place now JPEG holds. Tests seem to put WebP ahead of JPEG 
by a 39% file size margin, while holding at least as much quality as an equivalent 
JPEG. The format is lossy, as JPEG is, but seems to achieve better quality 
with less file size.

Google says they expect to get better compression percentages when starting 
from an uncompressed file rather than an already compressed one. I really want 
to see this at work, but again, people are VERY used to JPEGs by now, and in 
a broadband world, 100kB vs 61kB is not a big deal. Now, if you're downloading 
100's of images, that could very well make a big impact, but that's not the 
case with a very big portion of users.

Nevertheless, Google again shows they are concerned with making the web lighter, 
faster and easier, and I will be keeping an eye out for this new format.
