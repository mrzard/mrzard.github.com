When May comes to and end, I will end my one and a half years journey as
a CTO for [ChicPlace.com](http://www.chicplace.com).

The reasons for my depature are diverse, and possibly this is not the
best place to discuss them, but I am very grateful for the opportunity
to grow and learn while developing a project that has the potential to
be something special.

During this time I have gained a lot of experience managing teams, and
learnt a lot about myself, specially when it comes to working with
non-technical people, and how to manage expectations, deadlines and
organisation when working in a very fast-paced and very improvisational
startup.

I will write a list of things that I have learnt, in the form of:

-   List item.
    -   How it has affected me personally.

Things that I now know I have to improve on and play a very big role in
being a good CTO:

-   Voice disagreement and take a stand when needed
    -   Sometimes I have voiced disagreement with decisions by just
        making the Product team know I was against the decision made,
        but not stating why and how I could give a better solution.
    -   When I feel a decision is plain wrong (not just a difference in
        opinion) I have to stand my ground and not budge.
    -   Don’t be afraid of denying requests if you can back your denial
        with data.
-   Find a sweet spot between being hands-off and hands-on
    -   When handing out tasks I tend to plan them, and give them to
        someone on my team, then just wait for them to complete it.
        However, if they get stuck and ask for help I tend to sweep in
        and almost take over development. I have to improve because
        this, rightfully, can enrage senior developers, as well as be a
        hindrance to junior developers’ learning.
-   Be less aggressive with estimates.
    -   Most developers underestimate how long tasks will take, or the
        number of interruptions that will happen, and I am one of them
    -   An estimate like ‘3 days if I can work full-time on this’ is
        useless when you positively know that you will be able to put
        only 40-50% of your time in it. Say 7 to 9 days right away,
        because all your counterparts will remember is ‘you said 3 days’
-   Involve yourself in strategic decisions.
    -   I used to see myself as the technical element for a business.
        Now I see myself as the technical bridge for a business. I have
        to take a more direct approach and influence on the product
        side, become a domain expert so I can really understand the
        business needs and choose the best technical solution more
        easily.

Things that I think I got right:

-   Protect you team.
    -   Your team should not be interrupted by anyone. Concentration is
        key.
    -   Success is result of the team being awesome, or a team member
        exceeding expectations.
    -   Failure comes when we as managers fail to provide the team with
        the right information and opportunity.
    -   Basically, as a CTO, if your team succeeds it’s because they are
        awesome. If they fail it’s because you did not do your work.
-   Install a ticket-centric culture.
    -   No ad-hoc requests, everything has to go through a ticketing
        system (i.e. Redmine).
-   No premature optimization.
    -   We did not worry about going too deep into performance until we
        had a decent amount of functionality and traffic going.
-   Try to find a ‘good-enough’ solution, and keep improving it when
    it’s no longer good enough.
    -   Finding the perfect and definitive solution might be tempting, but when you work tight schedules, with the possibility of last-minute-changes on every turn, learning to recognise good-enough solutions will save you and your team tons of frustration.
-   Trust your team.
    -   I had immense luck in working with people like [Nadal Soler](https://twitter.com/nadalsol), [Denys Pasishnyi](https://twitter.com/dpcat237), [Marc Morera](https://twitter.com/mmoreram), [Aldo Chiecchia](https://twitter.com/zimage), [Tomoki Kamo](http://es.linkedin.com/pub/tomoki-kamo-mora/17/692/584), [Santi Castells](https://twitter.com/SantiCastells), [Alejandra Casal](http://es.linkedin.com/pub/alejandra-casal-tarr%C3%A9/53/335/450), [Mercè Fernàndez](http://justlivingcool.wordpress.com/), [Audrey Maman](http://fr.linkedin.com/pub/audrey-maman/31/279/139) and Olga de Mena, among others. All of them are exceptional at their jobs, and you can just be sure that their work will be top-class. As Tina Fey says on Bossypants “In most cases, being a good boss means hiring talented people and then getting out of their way”.
-   Always listen
    -   There are no stupid questions.
    -   There are no stupid suggestions.
    -   Not everything has to be decided by the managers.
    -   The idea that makes your business might be that one you didn’t
        want to listen to.

In a nutshell:

-   Measure everything. Try to improve. Rinse and repeat.
-   Build a great team. Trust them to do wonderful things. Assume they
    are awesome, let them prove you wrong: Most of the time they will
    not let you down.
-   Lose the fear to say NO.
-   Be kind, encourage the people around you.
-   Be honest, especially when it’s difficult. Dishonesty brings doubt
    and drives a wedge between team members.
