Due to [Posterous][1] closing soon I had to look for another place to host my (seldomly updated) blog. After 10 minutes, I saw GitHub Pages and then saw [Octopress][2]. The combination of both is awesome and really feels great for a developer instead of a classic web interface.

So, now you can find me here, at GitHub. Same content, same guy, same few updates!
