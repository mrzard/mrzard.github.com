VÃ­a '[Mark's stream of verbiage][1]' I found this article explaining some weird 
behaviour in MySQL, which may have you scratching your head someday (or already 
has had). It has to do with the 'strictness' of the errors, and how does MySQL 
react to them. It's worth the 3 minutes the article takes to read, and also 
the title is funny.
