Personal side
-------------

I am an ‘american football’ fan (specially fond of the Pittsburgh Steelers), and former player for the [Barcelona Búfals](http://www.barcelonabufals.com), where I tried to pass as a cornerback for some time.

I prefer rock music, but also dig heavy metal, blues and jazz. And my guilty pleasure are cheesy 80’s hits.

I play the bass guitar (badly).

I also read lots of books. One of my distinctive traits is to have a LOT of random data stored in my brain. Things like “Genghis Khan name was Temuyin. His wife’s: Borte”

I am expecting my first child, a girl, for mid-september 2014. She will be named Ada, part because my wife loves the name, and part as a homage to [Ada Lovelace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace)

Been with the same wonderful girl for the last 10 years, and enjoying every minute of it.
