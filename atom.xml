    <id>http://mrzard.github.com/blog/2012/02/15/release-cycles-and-policies-deploying-code-th</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my programming experience I have worked with different ways of handling
releases. From the old easy FTP access to other cool stuff like <a href="">phing</a>.</p>

<p>What I have learned is that it does not really matter which tools you use,
and is pretty much contained in the next points.</p>

<p>0 - Prepare for the release. Write a &#8216;script&#8217; of what code has been changed/added
and what tests it must pass (unit, integration, user&#8230;). Iterate until all
tests have passed. Then move the release to your staging server. Always have
100% awareness of what is going into the release.</p>

<p>1 - Have a proper staging server(s). This allows for good testing, and reduces
(hopefully eliminates) the necessity to double check stuff in the live server(s).</p>

<p>3 - The release has to work. Test everything, then test it again. Then release.
And go to 4.</p>

<p>4 - Shit happens. The relese does not always work. This is pretty common, specially
with large codebases, multiple programmers and code merging (SVN I&#8217;m looking
at you). Or discrepancies between your live servers and your testing servers.
Or simply someone forgot to run a test.</p>

<p>5 - Your release system must work for you, not against you. It&#8217;s fine to have
a release date / system, but fear not of changing it to fit your needs. This
leads us to the next point.</p>

<p>6 - Make it that the release system is quick and can be fired anytime. You
never know when you&#8217;re going to need an emergency fix. Make it easy to fix
mistakes. Also make it painful to make them. You don&#8217;t want developers feeling
confident they can release a half cooked solution and fix it later. I must
confess though that I prefer to release and fix than to never release.</p>

<p>7 - Use of tools like phing can help you a lot automating some boring stuff,
but again make deploying a simple procedure that has no bottlenecks and allows
you to eliminate any serious enough bug or mistake in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>8 - Do not fire your lean, quick release system for everything. That CSS fix
can wait until the next release.</p>

    <link href="http://mrzard.github.com/blog/2011/12/14/common-recruiting-errors-made-by-companies/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-14T10:26:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mrzard.github.com/blog/2011/12/14/common-recruiting-errors-made-by-companies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately I&#8217;ve seen a lot of posts about errors candidates make in interviews.
Now I am going to write a list of error employers make when looking for candidates.</p>

<p>1 - Adding them in LinkedIn without asking or even introducing themselves.</p>

<p>Guys,we get it, you are important. Now, please, the thing is YOU came looking
for us, not the other way around. Introduce yourself. Why are you adding me
as a contact? Keep in mind we do not know each other. For me this is the professional
equivalent to &#8220;hey, wanna hook up?&#8221; in a dating site.</p>

<p>2 - Recruting agencies special: Not disclosing which company they are recruiting
for</p>

<p>Yes, I can understand you want to be discreet and everything, but again, you
came looking for a candidate. Do you really expect a (hopefully) talented person
to engage in a (possibly) lengthy selection process when they know nothing
about their employer?</p>

<p>3 - Not stating salary / compensation</p>

<p>If you are out there looking for talent, that talent is most of the time already
employed. Why waste your time and the candidate&#8217;s time by making him/her go
to interviews just to know the salary bracket? Also, even for unemployed talent,
they will be drawn to the offers that give the most information. Hiding this
crucial piece of info makes no sense to me.</p>

<p>4 - Keeping a <code>you're _sooooo_ lucky</code> attitude</p>

<p>Yes, we are lucky because most of us love our jobs. That&#8217;s it. You came looking
for us, not the other way around, this is a key concept.<strong> You are the lucky
ones if we are the top-notch employees you are looking for:</strong> <strong>we make more
money for you than from you</strong>.</p>

<p>5 - Not having tech people at the interview</p>

<p>Personal interviews are fine, but we usually want to discuss details. Which
technologies are we going to use? How many users? How many people are on the
team? Is there a lot of turnover? Do we have a VPN so we can work remotely?
Frameworks? And these are just basic questions most of the time HR cannot answer.
Please, please, please, have a tech person there.</p>

<p>Have I left something out? (Pretty sure I have). Don&#8217;t hesitate to comment
and expand this list :D</p>

    <link href="http://mrzard.github.com/blog/2011/12/12/generate-a-valid-google-premier-signature-in/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-12T11:23:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mrzard.github.com/blog/2011/12/12/generate-a-valid-google-premier-signature-in</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google Premier requires for you to generate a signature over the URL you&#8217;re
going to ask for, then send that signature alongside the request. Here is how
to do it, as there is no PHP example in the <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/es-ES/apis/maps/documentation/webservices/#URLSigning">Google Primer URL Signature documentation</a></p>

<p>In this code snippet we assume:</p>

<ul>
<li>$request_url has the url that will be using the Google Premier service (for example, Static Maps API). It also already has the client param, sensor param, etc.</li>
<li>$signature_key has the key provided to you by Google</li>
<li>You are running this snippet from an authorized domain</li>
<li><p>Props to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3125410/trying-to-digitally-sign-via-hmac-sha1-with-php">ZZ Coder at StackOverflow</a></p>

<p>  $url_parts = parse_url($request_url); $signable_part = $url_parts[&#8216;path&#8217;].&#8217;?&#8217;.$url_parts[&#8216;query&#8217;];
  $decoded_key = base64_decode(strtr($signature_key, &#8216;-<em>&#8217;, &#8216;+/&#8217;); $url_signature
  = hash_hmac(&#8216;sha1&#8217;, $signable_part, $decoded_key), true); $base64signature
  = strtr(base64_encode($url_signature), &#8216;+/&#8217;, &#8216;-</em>&#8217;); $signature_param = &#8216;&amp;signature=&#8217;.urlencode($base64signature);</p></li>
</ul>


<p>&#8216;Strange&#8217; things in this snippet:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why the strtr()? Because Google uses URL-Safe base64</li>
<li>Why the true param at the end of hash_hmac? Because we need it the signature to be returned in binary before base64encondig it.</li>
</ul>


<p>Then you just have to append $signature_param to your original request (which
we&#8217;ve assumed is in $request_url) to have a correctly signed Google Premier
request.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week at work I had to make a drag-and-drop configurable homepage, where
individual news items had to had the ability to be moved and arranged in a
grid which represented the available placeholders on the homepage.</p>

<p>My work was made MUCH easier by the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/">draggable</a> and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/">droppable</a> plugins
in jQuery UI. I just had to add a class which I binded the draggable plugin
to to the news items and then add another class to the placeholders which I
binded to the droppable plugin.</p>

<p>In case it&#8217;s of help for somebody, here&#8217;s a quick &#8216;skeleton&#8217; on top of which
you can code the drag&amp;drop interactions you want.</p>

<pre><code>var draggable_options = { helper: 'clone', /* makes the item 'move' a copy 
of itself rather than 'leave' the original area */ revert: 'invalid', /* makes 
the item return to its original position if not dropped in a 'droppable' area 
*/ cursor: 'move' // changes the cursor appearance on hover }; //we give the 
items the draggable plugin with the options $(".draggable").draggable(draggable_options); 
$(".droppable").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { /* detect where we 
dropped the draggable element, in my case, the key part was the element's id 
*/ var dropped_in = $(this).attr('id'); /* here i put '...' in the droppable 
container's body to inform the user 'something' is happening */ var context 
= $(this); context.html('...'); var dragged = $(ui.draggable); /* ui.draggable 
is a reference to the dropped element now you can use all jQuery functions 
like dragged.attr('id') to get its id, or dragged.html('whatever') to change 
its innerHTML, etc... */ /* Here comes interaction, the removal of '...' and 
display of the action results */ } });

I was finally able to upgrade my system while chrooted.</p>

<p>Being on chroot will cause some packages to fail when they are upgrading. Giving
us an error message like this one:</p>

<p>start: Unable to connect to Upstart: Failed to connect to socket /com/ubuntu/upstart: Connection refused<br/>
dpkg: error processing procps (&#8211;configure):</p>

<p>You can workaround this limitation by running these commands</p>

<p>$dpkg-divert &#8211;local &#8211;rename &#8211;add /sbin/initctl<br/>
Adding &#8216;local diversion of /sbin/initctl to /sbin/initctl.distrib&#8217;<br/>
$ln -s /bin/true /sbin/initctl</p>

<p>Then you can run the upgrade, or do a dpkg &#8211;configure -a to upgrade the packages
that were previously failing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As seen in the Gawker/Gizmodo HUGE problem with having their passwords compromised,
I found a short and excellent post about why using speed-oriented hash functions
is a bad idea for password encryption.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, MD5, SHA1 and the like are designed to work fast with large
amounts of data, so they are most useful when calculating data integrity and
the like, but being fast, they are also easy to attack by brute force.</p>

<p>On the other hand <a href="http://bcrypt.sourceforge.net/">Bcrypt</a> is &#8216;slow&#8217; when compared with other hashing algorithms,
which makes it strong against brute force attacks. You can find the original
post here: <a href="http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/">http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/</a></p>

<p>I do not necessarily agree with the &#8216;uselessness&#8217; of salting passwords, as
that makes it harder to find a general pattern to attack ALL of the accounts
protected by a single password in the system, but I see the point of it not
being able to prevent or slow brute force attacks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2007/04/15/the_two_things_about_computer_programming/">This article</a> by Charles Miller says there are only two things that are
<strong>really important</strong> to any discipline. This may or may not be true, but I
really think he nailed it when it comes to programming.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Computer Programming:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Every problem can be solved by breaking it up into a series of smaller problems.</li>
<li>The computer will always do exactly what you tell it to.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Software Engineering:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Writing the code is the easy part. Writing it so someone else can understand it later is the important part.</li>
<li>Make it work, then make it elegant, then make it fast.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s very nice to see there are people out there who can summarize things in
such a comprehensive and spot-on manner.</p>

    <link href="http://mrzard.github.com/blog/2010/10/01/webp-the-new-google-image-format/"/>
    <updated>2010-10-01T09:44:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mrzard.github.com/blog/2010/10/01/webp-the-new-google-image-format</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WebP is the new format Google is pushing to come to the rescue of broadband
usage and get the place now JPEG holds. Tests seem to put WebP ahead of JPEG
by a 39% file size margin, while holding at least as much quality as an equivalent
JPEG. The format is lossy, as JPEG is, but seems to achieve better quality
with less file size.</p>

<p>Google says they expect to get better compression percentages when starting
from an uncompressed file rather than an already compressed one. I really want
to see this at work, but again, people are VERY used to JPEGs by now, and in
a broadband world, 100kB vs 61kB is not a big deal. Now, if you&#8217;re downloading
100&#8217;s of images, that could very well make a big impact, but that&#8217;s not the
case with a very big portion of users.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Google again shows they are concerned with making the web lighter,
faster and easier, and I will be keeping an eye out for this new format.</p>

    <id>http://mrzard.github.com/blog/2010/09/30/easy-virtualbox-setup-between-host-guest-and</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At work, we use <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> as our development box. Yesterday due to the
strike, I worked from home, and as I grew tired of changing network settings
to make my VirtualBox installation accessible, I gathered some info and found
a perfect solution.</p>

<p>First I created a Network adapter that used NAT. In most configurations that
will make your Virtual Machine have access &#8216;to the outside world&#8217; (provided
your host machine has access).</p>

<p>Then I created another connection using the host-only adapter. This ensures
you&#8217;ll have host to guest and guest to host connection no matter where you
are. For this connection, you&#8217;ll have to assign an static IP with address mask
255.255.255.0 and no default gateway on your host machine, then configure your
adapter in the guest with an IP in the same range, also with no default gateway.</p>

<p>With this you can access your guest machine using the IP in the range of the
host-only adapter, while the guest machine will be able to access anything
available to the host machine via the NAT connection.</p>

<p>Then if you need to have your guest machine available in other networks, you
just have to enable another adapter and configure it for the network in question.</p>

<p>With this configuration I now can plug my development machine (host and guest)
at home or at the office and just work with no further configuring.</p>

    <id>http://mrzard.github.com/blog/2010/09/24/a-new-take-on-php-object-oriented-programming</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think this is an interesting idea, check it out!</p>

<p><a href="http://dhotson.tumblr.com/post/1167021666/php-object-oriented-programming-reinvented">Antipodean - PHP OO Programming reinvented</a></p>

<p>Author Dennis Hotson says about it:</p>

<blockquote><p>There are some interesting implications of this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Classes can be hacked / patched / cloned. Methods can be added to classes at
any time</li>
<li>Classes can be scoped. They’re not global, unless you want them to be.</li>
<li>Classes can be temporary (and garbage collected).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Although I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that useful or advisable, it&#8217;s a great example
of how far you can push PHP&#8217;s limits.</p>
